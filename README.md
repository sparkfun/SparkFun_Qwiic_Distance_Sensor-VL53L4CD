This SparkFun Distance Sensor Breakout utilizes the VL53L4CD next generation ToF (Time of Flight) sensor module to give you the highly accurate measurements at short ranges for its size. The VL53L4CD from STMicroelectronics uses a VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) to emit an infrared laser to time the reflection to the target. That means that you will be able to measure the distance to an object from 1mm to 1300mm away with millimeter resolution! To make it even easier to get your readings, all communication is enacted exclusively via I<sup>2</sup>C, utilizing our handy Qwiic system so no soldering is required to connect it to the rest of your system. However, we still have broken out 0.1”-spaced pins in case you prefer to use a breadboard.

Each VL53L4CD sensor features a precision to be 1mm with an accuracy around +/-7mm (white target: 88%, indoor, no infrared) and a minimum read distance of this sensor is 1mm. The field of view for this little breakout has a typical full field of view of 18° with a read rate of up to 100Hz. Make sure to power this board appropriately since it will need 2.6V-3.5V to operate. Lastly, please be sure to remove the protective sticker on the VL53L1X before use otherwise it will, most assuredly, throw off your readings.

**Note:** This is a [CLASS 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_safety#Class_1) LASER PRODUCT CLASSIFIED IEC 60825-1 2014.
